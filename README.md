# SquadLink 

## Main goal
Finding teammates to play in cs2. 🔫

## Tech stack
- Client
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Redux Tool Kit
  - Styled Components
- NodeJS servers
  - Express
  - TypeScript
- Websocket Server
    -socketIO
- Steam Auth by [passport.js]

## Requirements
- node v18.17.1
- determination to open even one project file

## Description
### The application has features: 
- steam auth
- chat 
- create teams 
- search for players or teams 
- friends functions
- admin panel (the best UI ever)

Client is a dump of components with no structure. Same history with other services. I did a little directory separation, but anyway the services contain files with a huge amount of code inside, also somewhere there are ctr+c ctr+v boilerplates. 

The reason for this nightmare is simple, I didn't have time to deal with patterns and project structures, I just needed to finish this project (it's my diploma btw 😁) in time, so I took the easy way out.
 (touch at your own risk) 💙
